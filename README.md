# Option Pricing Tool

The first version of the tool currently supports European Options, computing prices using the Black-Scholes equation alongside Greeks and computation of Implied Volatility. Also offers plotting of all the previously mentioned calculations, including:

* Payoff graphs for both short and long positions if desired for the options.

* Greeks plotted against Spot price.

* Implied Volatility against Strike.

In the python notebook you will find examples of use for some of the functions developed by the tool as comparisons against market values using Yahoo Finance option data. 

This is an ongoing project that will have future revisions.
